        Hello, this is my 5th grade science project on what materials block wi-fi signals.
        I got the idea from sciencebuddies.org .

        <b>Abstract</b>
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        What materials can block a wifi signal
        <br>
        Objective: To find out what materials block wifi signals and which ones block stronger
        <br>Methods and materials: Surround or block the wifi router with various materials such as, a metal pot,
        wood,plastic,cardboard & aluminum foil. once this is done find the signal strength for each material by using
        wifi-info-view on the computer
        <br> Results: The average when the pot blocking the router was 85.33, making the pot block the most signal and
        the
        plastic blocked the least with an average of 98.33.
        Conclusion: When my testing was done i found out that the more tough and metallic materials blocked more
        signals than other materials.

        Problem
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        In todayâ€™s world internet connection has become the basic amenity and everybody uses it in daily life. However,
        many times people complain about weak wireless connection at their house or workplace. This can be caused by
        various materials covering or blocking your router. So I decided to test how these materials can affect your
        wireless connection.

    <p style="font-size:80px; border: 10px solid; padding: 20px;">
        Hyphothesis
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        I think that a metal object will block it the strongest because it is metal and it has a very thick border. And
        I think the cardboard box will block it the weakest because it is made out of cardboard.

    <p class="p2">
        I conducted each test by placing cone like or cylinder-like objects around the router, and sheet or wall-like
        objects in front of the object. Next, I found the data values using the app wifi-info-view. Then I recorded the
        data in my graph and in my journal. My basic knowledge is tougher, more surrounding materials will usually
        block more signals.
    </p>

        Materials and Procedures
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        My materials are wifi-info-view for finding my data. And a pot, aluminum foil, wood, cardboard box, computer,
        plastic container, and a router. I first covered or blocked my router with a material then I wrote down what
        was the signal quality when the material was present. Then I double-checked my data by repeating the process
        for each material 2 times and then finding an <u> average </u> for each.
