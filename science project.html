        Hello, this is my 5th grade science project on what materials block wi-fi signals.
        I got the idea from sciencebuddies.org .

        What materials can block a wifi signal

        Objective: To find out what materials block wifi signals and which ones block stronger
        Methods and materials: Surround or block the wifi router with various materials such as, a metal pot,
        wood,plastic,cardboard & aluminum foil. once this is done find the signal strength for each material by using
        wifi-info-view on the computer
        Results: The average when the pot blocking the router was 85.33, making the pot block the most signal and the
        plastic blocked the least with an average of 98.33.
        Conclusion: When my testing was done i found out that the more tough and metallic materials blocked more
        signals than other materials.
